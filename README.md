Let the prime factorization of p and q be:
p=r 
a 
1
​
 
 s 
b 
1
​
 
 ×other prime factors
q=r 
a 
2
​
 
 s 
b 
2
​
 
 ×other prime factors

The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of p and q is given by taking the highest power of each prime factor present in either p or q.
Given that LCM(p,q)=r 
2
 ×s 
3
 , and r and s are prime numbers, this means that in the prime factorizations of p and q:

The highest power of r is r 
2
 . This implies that max(a 
1
​
 ,a 
2
​
 )=2.
The highest power of s is s 
3
 . This implies that max(b 
1
​
 ,b 
2
​
 )=3.
There are no other prime factors in the LCM. This implies that any other prime factors present in p or q must have a power of 0 in the LCM.

Number of divisors =(e

In this case, LCM(p,q)=r

 ×s

 . The distinct prime factors are r and s, and their respective exponents are 2 and 3.

Using the formula for the number of divisors:
Number of divisors of LCM(p,q)=(exponent of r+1)×(exponent of s+1)
Number of divisors =(2+1)×(3+1)
Number of divisors =3×4
Number of divisors =12

Therefore, the number of divisors for LCM(p,q)=r

  is

==========================================================

write the LCM of p and q as a product of prime powers.

If you meant LCM(p,q)=r 
2
 ×s 
3
 ×v 
25
 , where r, s, and v are distinct prime numbers, then we can calculate the number of divisors in a similar way to the previous problem.

Given LCM(p,q)=r 
2
 ×s 
3
 ×v 
25
 , the exponents of the prime factors are:

Exponent of r is 2.
Exponent of s is 3.
Exponent of v is 25.

  is given by (e

In this case, the number of divisors of LCM(p,q) is:
Number of divisors =(exponent of r+1)×(exponent of s+1)×(exponent of v+1)
Number of divisors =(2+1)×(3+1)×(25+1)
Number of divisors =3×4×26
Number of divisors =12×26

To calculate 12×26:
12×26=12×(20+6)=(12×20)+(12×6)=240+72=312

Therefore, if LCM(p,q)=r

 , the number of divisors for LCM(p,q) is  
312
